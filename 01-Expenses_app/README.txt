This is my first react Project.

To use the project follow the folloewing steps- 
1. clone this repo to your local ide setup
2. run the following commands
  
   (A) npm install
   (B) npm start
   In this repo only the main code is pushed, so in order to use this project we need to install all the node-modules which is done using "npm- install".
   "npm-start" is used to start the server at port 3000.
